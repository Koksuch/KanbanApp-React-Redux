# Kanban App - React, Redux, Tailwind

[Live Demo](https://master--prismatic-alfajores-6bd79d.netlify.app/)

Design for this app was taken from one of the challanges on [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB)

Main reason to create this app was to learn [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) library. All data in App are stored in browser's Local Storage.
In the future I have plans to add backend with database to this project.
